The dump included in this folder contains a capture where data values was altered using CI600 panel.
Note: at first i was not able to enter any values. After cycling power supply to HVAC unit i was able to alter values. However the telegram lenghts differ from what was previously expected, they are now longer. It seems like the CS60 maybe detects the panel type connected and alters the telegrams???
